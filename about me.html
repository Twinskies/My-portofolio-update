        <li>I enjoy playing computer games with my friends and spending time together having fun.<br>
            Whether we’re exploring virtual worlds or challenging each other in competitive games,<br>
            these moments are always full of laughter and good energy. It’s our favorite way to relax <br>
            and enjoy our free time.

        <li>I enjoy practicing Greco-Roman wrestling; it’s a way for me to release stress and relax.<br>
            This sport has taught me a lot about discipline, self-control, and respect. Besides the physical<br>
             benefits, wrestling helps me balance my mind and body, giving me a sense of freedom and calm.

        <li>I love cooking different dishes, especially creating new meals. Although desserts aren’t my strong<br>
             suit, sometimes I surprise myself and they turn out well! The process of cooking allows me to be<br>
            creative and experiment, and the final result is always satisfying, whether it’s a dessert or a delicious<br>
             main course.

             expression for me and allow me to develop my creativity. Whether it’s a new canvas or a craft project,<br>
            I feel inspired to create something unique and personal.
